    "### A1. Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will continue the exploration that I started in D208, looking at which variables affect the readmission of a patient. Using a logistic regression I found that there were no statistically significant variables that caused readmission for a patient and there were only three variables that had any affect on readmission. Therefore for this porject I want to use a different model to test the readmission rates. Therefore the research question I will be answering is: **Which variables, if any, affect the readmission rate for patients?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2. Objective and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to see if a better model can shed light on readmission to hospital. While the logistic Regression model didn't show statistical significance in the variables affecting readmission rates there were so many limitations to the model that it isn't clear if the data or the model are the issue. Therefore testing the same research question with a new model will help to clarify. The importance of figuring out which factors play a roll in readmission to hospital is multifaceted. First of all knowing when a patient arrives at hospital if they present with variables that affect readmission will allow the care team to mitigate those variables in hopes to avoid the readmission. Secondly, readmission costs money for both the hospital and the patients so figuring out why readmission occurs will allow hospitals to put resources to those causes. \n",

    "### B1. K Nearest Neighbors Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The K nearest neighbors, also known as KNN, method of classification maps each data point based on the predictor variables so that when a new unknown data point is added the model will look at the 'K' closest known data points and assign the unknown data point based on the known data around it. 'K' in this being some integer that best fits the data. In the case of hospital readmission we will be trying to classify new rows as readission or not based on where the predictor variables places the unknown set in relation to the known data. When selecting a 'k' it's important to make sure that the model is not over or under fitting. Generally a larger 'k' will cause underfitting while a smaller 'k' will cause overfitting. In order to test for a correct value of 'k' we can loop the model through multiple 'k''s and chart the accuracies from each iteration. There we can find the correct value of 'k' for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B2. Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the KNN classification model to work our data has to meet certain assumptions. Arguably one of the most important assumptions that the data must meet for the KNN model to work is that similar things fall near each other in the feature space. This is important because the KNN model uses nearby datapoints to label unknown data and to classify the unknown there has to be a majority grouping or else the model is nothing more than random guessing. [Its All About Assumptions](https://medium.com/swlh/its-all-about-assumptions-pros-cons-497783cfed2d)\n",
    "\n",
    "### B3. Packages and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will be using python. Python is a great programming language for data analysis because of it's sandbox nature and the ability to import packages and libraries for each specific project. For this project I will be primarily using the SciKit-learn library as well as the standard data analysis packages.\n",

    "One of the other important assumptions of the KNN model is that the variables are stored as integers. Since this is not the case for most of the variables in this dataset the biggest processing will be to use one hot encoding to transform all of the categorical variables to numerical values. For the binary columns this will be an easy fix of transforming the yes and no values to 1/0 values. However for the variables that have more than two values we will use the one hot encoding method which creates dummy variables for each of the values and uses 1/0 to indicate whether the value is present or not.

    "As described above the K-nearest neighbors model maps the data according to the features. When data with unknown labels are entered into the model the new data will be cross referenced to the data that falls closest to it in the mapping. In this case the 44 nearest neighbors are checked for their readmission value, the value with the most in the 44 neighbors is then given to the unknown data. In theory this will allow us to label new patients as having a risk of readmission or not. However since the model is untested we cannot say with accuracy that the variables have any significance to the readmission of patients, therefore in the following section I will use the data set aside as test data to test the model created here and since the values of readmission are known in the test data we can run the model and then compare to the actual values to see how accurate the model is."

The first is a confusion matrix which will map the results of the test data into a square, with how many data points were correct or not in the readmission label. I will also calculate the accuracy of the model using the amount of data points correctly and incorrectly predicted. The accuracy will give us a percentage for how accurate the model is on unknown data. \n",

This metric shows the performance of the model with a bisecting diagonal line which represents what the model would look like if completely random. The model performance is then plotted with any part of the line under the random classification line representing performance worse than random and any part above the random classification line as being better than random. To then classify how much better or worse the model did than random we can calculate the AUC."

    "### E2. Results and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "While the precision score of the model for predicting no readmission is 63%, the accuracy of the model and the AUC score show that the model is very poor at being a reliable tool for predicting a patient's readmission likelihood. This model in fact is less effective than the logistic regression model I made for the D208 performance assessment. Overall this KNN model is unable to tell us anything of use and should not be used to help predict readmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E3. Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset being using here is limited in that it likely does not meet the assumption stated above for a KNN model to work accurately. That is the readmission occurance seems to have little to do with the variables that were taken for the dataset and therefore the assumpting that similar things exist near each other is not the case when it comes to this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E4. Course of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this model shows no good metric for classifying readmission for patients I have no course of action based on this dataset for the hospital. However I would suggest that a complete reframing of the data being obtained by the hospital would be a great place to start in finding ways to decrease readmission rates. Since the dataset that was collected has not been useful in the prediction of readmission I believe that working to reassess what data should be tracked and then setting up a study to create a whole new dataset with new variables would be the best course of action. \n",
